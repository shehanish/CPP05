-what is an exception in c++?

An exception is a way for your program to say:
	"Soemthing went wrong, and i dont know how to handle it here;
	please go to the nearest catch block"

-instead of crashing or doing weird things, your program can "throw" and exception and 
 "catch" it somewhere safe. 

**An exception is an object that signals an error or unexpected situation. 

**nested classes**
when you are wirting a class inside another class, yu call it a nested class
